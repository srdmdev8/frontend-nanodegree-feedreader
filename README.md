About the App
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application pulls feeds from the Google Feed Reader API. I was expected to write tests using the Jasmine testing framework. There is a total of 7 tests within 4 different sections. You can see the results displayed at the bottom of the application.

The tests you should see are displayed below:
- The RSS Feeds
  - Should be defined
  - Should have a URL defined and not empty
  - Should have a name defined and not empty
- The Menu
  - Should be hidden by default
  - Should display/hide when clicked
-The Initial Entries
  - Should have at least one entry
- The New Feed Selection
  - Should load a new feed
